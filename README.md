# Project Background

Cyclistic is a pioneering bike-sharing service based in Chicago that has rapidly transitioned from a niche startup to a mainstream pillar of urban transportation. Launched with a mission to make eco-friendly commuting accessible to all, Cyclistic features a diverse fleet of over **5,800** bicycles, including standard two-wheelers, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, spread across a network of **692** tracking stations.
Initially popularized by local weekend explorers and tourists, Cyclistic has seen a massive surge in "mainstream" adoption. As Chicago infrastructure continues to prioritize green lanes and sustainable transit, Cyclistic has become a primary choice for daily commuters.

# The Business Challenge
Despite its growing popularity, Cyclistic’s financial success depends on more than just total ridership. The marketing strategy currently focuses on two distinct segments:
  - **Casual Riders**: Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes.
  - **Cyclistic Members**: Annual subscribers who use the service for consistent, daily transit.
## My Goal: 
As a Junior Data Analyst, I am analyzing historical trip data to identify how these two groups use Cyclistic differently. By understanding these patterns, I aim to design a data-driven strategy to convert casual riders into loyal, annual members, securing the company's long-term growth.
## Why does this matter? 
By increasing the amount of members, we establish:
  - **Predictable revenue**: recurring income guaranteed, allows for company maintenance, expansion, and infrastructure upgrades.
  - **Operational efficiency**: More predictable behaviors towards bike usage, such as commuters.
  - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Easier to maintain an existing member than it is to find new riders.
