# Project Background

Cyclistic is a pioneering bike-sharing service based in Chicago that has rapidly transitioned from a niche startup to a mainstream pillar of urban transportation. Launched with a mission to make eco-friendly commuting accessible to all, Cyclistic features a diverse fleet of over **5,800** bicycles, including standard two-wheelers, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, spread across a network of **692** tracking stations.
## The Growth Story
Initially popularized by local weekend explorers and tourists, Cyclistic has seen a massive surge in "mainstream" adoption. As Chicago infrastructure continues to prioritize green lanes and sustainable transit, Cyclistic has become a primary choice for daily commuters.
